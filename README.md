## `Python SDK for Contentstack`

Contentstack is a headless CMS with an API-first approach. It is a CMS that developers can use to build powerful cross-platform applications in their favorite languages. Build your application frontend, and Contentstack will take care of the rest. [`Read More`](https://www.contentstack.com/).

Contentstack provides Python SDK to build application on top of Python. Given below is the detailed guide and helpful resources to get started with our Python SDK.

### `Prerequisite`

You will need python 3 installed on your machine. You can install it from [`here`](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.4/python-3.7.4-macosx10.9.pkg).

### `Setup and Installation`

To use the Contentstack Python SDK to your existing project, perform the steps given below:

### `Install contentstack pip`

	```pyhton
	pip install contentstack
	```
	

This is the preferred method to install contentstack, as it will always install the most recent stable release. If you don't have [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/) installed, this [`Python installation guide`](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/) can guide you through the process

### `Key Concepts for using Contentstack`

#### `Stack`

A stack is like a container that holds the content of your app. Learn more about [`Stacks`](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/set-up-stack).

#### `Content Type`

Content type lets you define the structure or blueprint of a page or a section of your digital property. It is a form-like page that gives Content Managers an interface to input and upload content. [`Read more`](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/create-content-types).

#### `Entry`

An entry is the actual piece of content created using one of the defined content types. Learn more about [`Entries`](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/content-managers/work-with-entries).

#### `Asset`

Assets refer to all the media files (images, videos, PDFs, audio files, and so on) uploaded to Contentstack. These files can be used in multiple entries. Read more about [`Assets`](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/content-managers/work-with-assets).

#### `Environment`

A publishing environment corresponds to one or more deployment servers or a content delivery destination where the entries need to be published. Learn how to work with [`Environments`](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/set-up-environments).

### `Contentstack Python SDK: 5-minute Quickstart`

#### `Initializing your SDK`

To initialize the SDK, specify application  API key, access token, and environment name of the stack as shown in the snippet given below, You can provide optional parameters for config:

    ```python
	stack = contentstack.Stack('api_key','delivery_token','environment')
	```

To get the API credentials mentioned above, log in to your Contentstack account and then in your top panel navigation, go to Settings &gt; Stack to view the API Key and Access Token.

#### `Querying content from your stack`

To retrieve a single entry from a content type use the code snippet given below:

	```python
	stack = contentstack.Stack('api_key','delivery_token','environment')
	content_type = stack.content_type("content_type_uid")
	entry = content_type.entry("entry_uid")
	result = entry.fetch()
	```

##### `Get Multiple Entries`

To retrieve multiple entries of a particular content type, use the code snippet given below:

	```python
	stack = contentstack.Stack('api_key','delivery_token','environment')
	query = stack.content_type("content_type_uid").query()
	result = query.find()
	```


### `Advanced Queries`

You can query for content types, entries, assets and more using our Python API Reference.

[Python API Reference Doc](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/platforms/python/api-reference/)

### `Working with Images`

We have introduced Image Delivery APIs that let you retrieve images and then manipulate and optimize them for your digital properties. It lets you perform a host of other actions such as crop, trim, resize, rotate, overlay, and so on.

For example, if you want to crop an image (with width as 300 and height as 400), you simply need to append query parameters at the end of the image URL, such as, `https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blteae40eb499811073/bltc5064f36b5855343/59e0c41ac0eddd140d5a8e3e/download?crop=300,400`. There are several more parameters that you can use for your images.

[`Read Image Delivery API documentation`](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/platforms/python/api-reference/).

You can use the Image Delivery API functions in this SDK as well. Here are a few examples of its usage in the SDK.

	```python
	image = stack.image_transform(url, {'quality': 100}).get_url()
	image = stack.image_transform(url, {'width': 100, 'height': 100}).get_url()
	image = stack.image_transform(url, {'auto': 'webp'}).get_url()
	```

### `Using the Sync API with Python SDK`

The Sync API takes care of syncing your Contentstack data with your application and ensures that the data is always up-to-date by providing delta updates. Contentstack’s Python SDK supports Sync API, which you can use to build powerful applications.

	```python
	stack = contentstack.Stack('api_key','delivery_token','environment')
	#initialize sync
	response = stack.sync_init()
	#sycn using sync token
	response = stack.sync_token('sync_token')
	#sycn using pagination token
	response = stack.pagination('pagination_token')
	#sync using multiple parameters
	response = stack.sync_init(publish_type='entry_published', content_type_uid='content_type_uid')
	```

Read through to understand how to use the Sync API with Contentstack Python SDK.
