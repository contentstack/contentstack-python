Python SDK for Contentstack
===========================

  Contentstack is a headless CMS with an API-first approach. It is a CMS that developers can use to build powerful cross-platform applications in their favorite languages. Build your application frontend, and Contentstack will take care of the rest. `Read More <https://www.contentstack.com/>`_.

  Contentstack provides Python SDK to build an application on top of Python. Given below is the detailed guide and helpful resources to get started with our Python SDK.

Prerequisite
============

  You will need python 3 installed on your machine. You can install it from `here <https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.4/python-3.7.4-macosx10.9.pkg>`_

Setup and Installation
======================

  To use the Contentstack Python SDK to your existing project, perform the steps given below:

.. code-block:: python
    install contentstack pip

This is the preferred method to install contentstack, as it will always install the most recent stable release. If you don't have `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/>`_
installed, this `Python installation guide <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/>`_ can guide you through the process


Key Concepts for using Contentstack
-----------------------------------

**Stack**

  A stack is like a container that holds the content of your app. Learn more about `Stacks <https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/set-up-stack>`_.

**Content-Type**

  Content-type lets you define the structure or blueprint of a page or a section of your digital property. It is a form-like page that gives Content Managers an interface to input and upload content. `read_more <https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/create-content-types>`_.

**Entry**

    An entry is the actual piece of content created using one of the defined content types. Learn more about `Entries <https://www.contentstack.com/docs/content-managers/work-with-entries>`_.

**Asset**

    Assets refer to all the media files (images, videos, PDFs, audio files, and so on) uploaded to Contentstack. These files can be used in multiple entries. Read more about `Assets <https://www.contentstack.com/docs/content-managers/work-with-assets>`_.

**Environment**

    A publishing environment corresponds to one or more deployment servers or a content delivery destination where the entries need to be published. Learn how to work with `Environments <https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/set-up-environments)>`_.



Contentstack Python SDK: 5-minute Quickstart
--------------------------------------------

**Initializing your SDK**

    To initialize the SDK, specify the application  API key, access token, and environment name of the stack as shown in the snippet given below:

.. code-block:: python

   stack = contentstack.Stack('api_key', 'delivery_token', 'environment')


To get the API credentials mentioned above, log in to your Contentstack account and then in your top panel navigation, go to Settings &gt; Stack to view the API Key and Access Token.



**Querying content from your stack**

To retrieve a single entry from a content type use the code snippet given below:

.. code-block:: python

   content_type = stack.content_type("content_type_uid")
   entry = content_type.entry("entry_uid")
   result = entry.fetch()


**Get Multiple Entries**

To retrieve multiple entries of a particular content type, use the code snippet given below:


**stack is an instance of Stack class**

.. code-block:: python

   query = stack.content_type("content_type_uid").query()
   result = query.find()

**Advanced Queries**

     You can query for content types, entries, assets, and more using our Java API Reference. `Python API Reference Doc <https://www.contentstack.com/docs/platforms/python/api-reference/>`_


**Working with Images**

    We have introduced Image Delivery APIs that let you retrieve images and then manipulate and optimize them for your digital properties. It lets you perform a host of other actions such as crop, trim, resize, rotate, overlay, and so on.

*For example:*

    If you want to crop an image (with a width of 300 and height of 400), you simply need to append query parameters at the end of the image URL, such as

.. code-block:: python

   https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/download?crop=300,400


There are several more parameters that you can use for your images. `Read Image Delivery API documentation <https://www.contentstack.com/docs/platforms/python/api-reference/>`_

You can use the Image Delivery API functions in this SDK as well. Here are a few examples of its usage in the SDK.

.. code-block:: python

   url = stack.image_transform(image_url, {'quality': 100})
   url = stack.image_transform(imageUrl, {'width': 100, 'height': 100})
   url = stack.image_transform(imageUrl, {'auto': 'webp'})

**Using the Sync API with Python SDK**

    The Sync API takes care of syncing your Contentstack data with your application and ensures that the data is always up-to-date by providing delta updates. Contentstack’s Python SDK supports Sync API, which you can use to build powerful applications.

Read through to understand how to use the Sync API with Contentstack Python SDK. `Using the Sync API with Python SDK <https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/python/using-the-sync-api-with-python-sdk>`_
